This script is an accessory script to edit segmentation errors caused by extra tissue in our main script, "Placenta Analysis".
For access to the Placenta Analysis script, see our GitHub at: https://github.com/Kriegsfeld-Lab/Placenta-Analysis-2021.git

There are three conditions that we found in the results of the Placenta Analysis script that we believed necessitated an editor script.
In order to use the editor script, the LZ and JZ need to have been correctly segmented by the Placenta Analysis code. 
The comon errors are as follows: 1) the decidua (DC) tissue was connected to the labrynth zone (LZ) tissue in the LZ segmentation, 
2) the junctional zone (JZ) tissue was connected to chorionic plate tissue in the JZ segmentation, or 3) extra tissue such as chorionic 
plate or yolk sac was present in the LZ segmentation that would likely throw off the results for the area and perimeter of the LZ.
 
To remedy these issues, we created this accessory script to allow user input for excess tissue removal. Specifically, this code 
asks the user which issue they are experiencing (1, 2, or 3) and allows the user to trace the tissue that they would like to be removed.
The code also re-runs the calculations that will be affected by the tissue removal and prints a .csv file with the new values.
These values are in the same order as the values printed from "Placenta Analysis", with 0s as placeholders for any values that did not 
change with the new calculations. To use the code, edit the file directory pathways in lines 6, 124, 228, and 303.
